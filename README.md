# Shroom TD

Shroom TD is a Tower Defense game developed entirely in python using pygame.
The goal is to place towers (mushrooms) in order to prevent ennemies (slimes) to reach the end of the path,
And to make it throught all the waves

This project uses musics from Waterflame who owns all rights on these musics

## About
This project has been made for the "Troph√©es NSI" of 2023.

Having always played games, we wanted to make OUR game. So we gathered all we were taught during these past 2 years and decided to try and make a game of one of our favorite genre, a Tower Defense.
All the assets are made by us (mostly SparkasseLabank) and we decided the universe of the game, we wanted one that would fit us and we came up with that bit of a crazy idea to make mushrooms fight slimes.
The project took us overall approximately 2 months to make.
It was also a chance to further develop our skills in python and discover pygame

## Controls
LMB = interact, select...
RMB = deselect
Esc = open escape menu
Alt + F4 = quit game in most menus

## Getting Started
In order for the project to work, you must execute it from the same folder where run.py is
And to not have moved anything from their respective folders

## Installing
First, verify you have python and pygame installed
if you have then you just have to download all the project and it should be working
in the opposite case, install python
then install pygame by going in the cmd and type :"pip install pygame"
